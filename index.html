        <h1>Typical development</h1>

        <p>
          <a href="https://tripycal.com/">Tripycal.com</a> is a travel blog that
          offers an array of fascinating travel stories and guides, particularly
          focusing on lesser-known destinations and unique experiences. For
          example, it features detailed narratives about exploring the charming
          city of Wroclaw, including a tranquil walk through the Wroclaw
          Botanical Garden and the hidden Ossolineum Garden. The blog is ideal
          for nature enthusiasts and those who appreciate picturesque cityscapes
          and hidden gems. It also covers day trips to historical sites and
          local markets, providing practical tips and beautiful photography to
          inspire travelers.

        <h2>Classical awareness</h2>

        <p>
          Developers often realize that writing good code using modern
          technologies is not enough for a project to succeed. A successful
          project requires considering many factors beyond just programming. The
          first problem in our case was the inability to convince Google to show
          us in search results. This might be related to our lack of
          understanding of how pages get indexed in search results. Most likely,
          both reasons are contributing factors.

      <section>
        <h2>Available content</h2>

        <p>
          We started with the idea that we had content. It seemed that there was
          an audience for this content as well (if we trust Google's search
          query statistics). The only problem is that it's not entirely clear
          how to get into Google's search results for these queries. We thought
          that the quality of the content we offer is slightly higher, but this
          is all very subjective, and Google determines it based only on
          indirect signals. That's why we decided to start with the basics and
          the classics - a website and a blog.
