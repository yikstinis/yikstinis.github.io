# Yikstinis Page

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files
through a build process, and publishes a website. It is designed to host your
personal, organization, or project pages from a GitHub repository.

## Tripycal

[Tripycal.com](https://tripycal.com/) - a project about interesting places and
ways to spend time. It should allow users to find new places in their city and
surrounding area, not miss something cool while traveling, and share their
favorite places and impressions from the trip.
